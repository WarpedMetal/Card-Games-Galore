# Card-Games-Galore-Team6-Section2
Repo for CS321 project collaboration

For our project, Card Game Galore, we would like you to start off by running the program. 
Then because this is your fist time playing the game you decide to start off by reading the rules for War.
You then close out of the rules window and decide to play a game, so you click play.
You then get a pop up for the Game of War. You can play by clicking on your deck. AKA the upside down card labeled Player 1.
This will continue until the game is complete. Once the game ends, or you get bored with War, you may cick the button to return to the main menu.
Then you decide that you want to play Go Fish so you set the drop down box to go fish. 
You quickly read the rules, and then click play.
This will pop up a window for Go Fish you can play by clicking on any of the cards in your hand. The text box will tell you what is going on in the game.
You can keep guessing until you get it wrong, in which the text will change from it's your turn to it's the AI's turn. When it is the AI's turn you can click the AI's turn button for them to play. 
Continue this until it says that it's your turn again, repeat this process until someone wins. Then return to the main menu.
Now that you have played you would like to veiw your stats.
So you select the gae you would want to see the stats for and click the high scores button. This shows the stats for any game in a pop up window. 
Now that you have done that you are free to mess around with the games however you would like.
